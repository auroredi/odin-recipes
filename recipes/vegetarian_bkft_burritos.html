       <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This breakfast burrito contains 3 sources of vegetarian protein: eggs, tofu, and cheese. 
            It omits the potatoes frequently found in other breakfast burrito recipes 
            and calls for Carb Chopper tortillas in order to reduce carbohydrates while giving it a higher 
        fiber profile.</p>
